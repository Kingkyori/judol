# Judol (Learning Project)

A simple Next.js app for learning purposes that demonstrates an admin-user linked configuration: admin sets jackpot odds and toggle flags; user view reflects those settings and simulates outcomes.

## Quick Start

```bash
# install deps
npm install

# run dev server
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build

# start production server
npm run start
```

## Features
- Admin page to adjust jackpot percentage and toggles.
- User page to read settings and simulate jackpot outcomes.
- Simple JSON storage for settings via API routes.

## Notes
- This app is for sosialisasi/pembelajaran only.
- No authentication by default; you can add a shared token later for admin routes.
